The results after the first compilation show that the critical path starts from the input LSB, i.e. A[0], crosses all carry generator blocks, enters the carry-in of the last carry_select_block; eventually flows as an output at the end of this block (S[31]). 
All other paths among the 10 worst ones, start from an input LSB, pass trough the same pattern but exit at the output MSB -1 with respect to the previous one (S[30], S[29], S[28] and so on).	
After defining the timing constraints, the critical path starts at A[0], passes trough the carry generator and exits at C8 (C[2] in the vhdl description) entering in the second carry_select_block of the sum generator; at this point it pass trough all the block and exit at S[12] as an output. With this configuration the path is then requiring 0.54 ns, thus a slack of -0,02 is present; The time is reduced from 0.65 to 0.54, thus improving the circuit performance, but a negative slack means that the constraint is not satisfied.
  Using a script file, it is possible to obtain in a faster and cleaner way all the needed results. Specifically, the scrip saves the relevant files in the chosen directory. 
Among the timing report generated, the one generated before the time constraints addition shows a critical path starting from A[0] and moving trough the carry generator up to C5 and falling in the sum generator in the 6th block, thus exiting at S[24]; the imposed time optimization of 0.58 (it is possible to notice that the slack is -0.06 if compared to the 0.52 constraint previously applied); the one generated instead after the time constraints are application shows a critical path that starts from A[0] and moves to the carry generator, then to the sum generator in C2 and finally it exits in S[12], this is the very same path obtained with the previous constrained compilation not using the script, also the slack has the same value as before, -0.02, and this means that the time constraint is not satisfied again, even if some improvements still are present if this result is compared to the one without any constraint.
