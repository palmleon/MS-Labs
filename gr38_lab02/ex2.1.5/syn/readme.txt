The results after the first compilation show that the critical path starts from the input LSB, i.e. A[0], crosses all carry generator blocks, enters the carry-in of the last CSB (Carry Select Block); eventually, it flows as an output at the end of this block (S[31]). 
All other paths among the 10 worst ones always start from an input LSB, pass through the same pattern but exit at the output of the adiacent bits with respect to the MSB (S[30], S[29], S[28] and so on).
All the worst paths have the same starting point because the LSB crosses the special G block where the Cin enters the logic, so these inputs need to propagate from at least one block more than the others.
After defining the timing constraints, the critical path starts at A[0], passes through the carry generator and exits at C8 (C[2] in the VHDL description); then, it enters in the second CSB of the Sum Generator; at this point, it crosses all the block and exits at S[12].In this configuration, we require that the latency should be at most equal to 0.54 ns, thus a slack of -0,02 ns is present and the constraint is not met. 
On the other hand, there is a latency optimization from 0.65 to 0.54 ns, thus improving the timing, but not reaching the desired latency value.
Using a script, it is possible to achieve the same results faster and in a cleaner way. In particular, the script saves the relevant files in the chosen directory. 
In the second part of this synthesis step, we use the script to synthesize the circuit and we analyze the results as before.
Among the timing reports, the one generated before setting time constraints shows a critical path that starts from A[0] and goes through the carry generator up to C20 and falling in the sum generator in the 6th block, thus exiting at S[24]; the imposed time optimization leads to a latency of 0.58ns (it is possible to notice that the slack is -0.06ns if compared to the 0.52ns constraint previously applied); the other report, generated after setting the constraint, shows a critical path that starts from A[0] and moves to the carry generator, then to the sum generator in C8 and finally it exits in S[12]. This path is exactly the same path that we obtained when setting the time constraint and without using any script; as a consequence, the slack has the same value as before, which is -0.02 ns.
