The results after the first compilation shows that the critical path starts from the input LSB, A[0] in this specific case, then it pass trough all blocks present in the carry generator entering into the carry-in of the last carry_select_block and exiting as an output at the end of this block, S[31] specifically. 
All other paths amid the 10 worst ones start also from an input LSB, pass trough the same pattern but exit at the output MSB -1 respect to the previous (S[30], S[29], S[28] and so on).	
After the timing constraints are defined the critical path is the one that starts from A[0], pass trough the carry generator and exits at C8 (C[2] in the vhdl description) entering then in the second carrt_select_block of the sum generator; at this point it pass trough all the block and exit at S[12] as an output. With this configuration the path is then requiring 0.54 ns, thus a slack of -0,02 is present; The time is reduced from 0.65 to 0.54, improving so circuit performances, but a negative slack means that the this constraint of 0.52 is not satisfied.
Using then a script file it is possible to obtain in a fast and clean way all the needed results, in this case the script is organized so that the compilation procedure is automatically performed saving the files in the relative directory; Among the timing report so generated, the one generated before the time constraints addition shows a critical path that starts from A[0] and moves trough the carry generator, exits in C5, and finally enter the sum generator in the 6th block, exiting so at S[24] specifically; the time is in this case 0.58 (it is possible to notice that the slack is -0.06 if compared to the 0,52 constraint previously applied); the one generated instead after the time constraints are application shows a critical path that starts from A[0] and moves to the carry generator, then to the sum generator in C2 and finally it exits in S[12], this is the very same path obtained with the previous constrained compilation not using the script, also the slack has the same value as before, -0.02, and this means that the time constraint is not satisfied again, even if some improvements still are present if this result is compared to the one without any constraint.
