SU violation:
In the following lines, we refer to the LH transition, but the FF behaves exactly in the same manner in the HL transition. Obviously, in that case the logic state of the signals is exactly the opposite (high signals are low and viceversa.
 First, we notice that CPI does not correspond to CK exactly, probably there is a buffer in front of the CK signal that generates CPI. This explains why CPN toggles faster than CPI. About the MN/M signals that compose the bistable circuit of the master, we notice that MN toggles as desired, while M reacts slowly and begins to toggle only when the master is already in the Memory phase. Since M is still low, it tends to raise MN. As a consequence, the bistable circuit returns to the previous state, where MN was high and M was low. SN, S and Q result almost unaffected by what has happened in the master
