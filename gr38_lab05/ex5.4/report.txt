The difference between the two gates is particularly noticeable in the high load case (Cload = 50fF), since the smallest gate is not able to drive it with sufficient speed. 
The main reason why this difference occurs is in the size of the gates, and in particular of the transistor that compose them: all the transistors of the NANDX8 gate have double W with respect to the small NAND gate, which implies a higher current driving capability. 
Being able to drive higher currents, the gate charges the load much faster, thus not suffering from such a high load.
However, in case of a small load (case where Cload = 0.05fF), there is not a noticeable difference in delay between the two gates, but the short-circuit current is much larger for the NANDX8: using wider gates for small loads increases power consumption without improving delay noticeably; this means that it is more optimal to use a smaller gate in that case.
