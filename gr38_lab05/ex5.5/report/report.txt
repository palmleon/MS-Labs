We can notice that the LL gates provide lower currents since they are designed to have a higher threshold voltage and have a lower current driving capability, thus implying higher propagation delay as more time is required to charge the load.
However, it is for this reason that LL gates can save switching power, reducing the short-circuit current.
Moreover, LL gates have lower leakage currents since they have a higher threshold voltage, further reducing power dissipation.
